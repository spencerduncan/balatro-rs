//! Acceptance tests for efficient state access patterns
//!
//! These tests verify the requirements from issue #169:
//! - Concurrent-safe data structures for game state access
//! - Batch update mechanisms for state modifications
//! - Optimized read-heavy access patterns for AI/RL applications
//! - Minimal lock contention in multi-threaded scenarios
//! - Data consistency across concurrent operations
