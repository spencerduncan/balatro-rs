/// Effect that a joker can apply to modify game state.
///
/// `JokerEffect` represents the comprehensive impact a joker can have on the game
/// when triggered. Effects can modify scoring, award resources, trigger special
/// mechanics, or even destroy jokers and transform cards.
///
/// # Effect Categories
///
/// ## Scoring Effects
/// - **Chips**: Bonus chips added to hand total (`chips`)
/// - **Mult**: Bonus mult added to hand total (`mult`)
/// - **Mult Multiplier**: Percentage multiplier applied to total mult (`mult_multiplier`)
///
/// ## Resource Effects  
/// - **Money**: Coins awarded to the player (`money`)
/// - **Hand Size**: Temporary hand size modification (`hand_size_mod`)
/// - **Discards**: Temporary discard count modification (`discard_mod`)
///
/// ## Special Effects
/// - **Retrigger**: Number of times to retrigger the effect (`retrigger`)
/// - **Self Destruction**: Whether this joker destroys itself (`destroy_self`)
/// - **Other Destruction**: Other jokers to destroy (`destroy_others`)
/// - **Card Transformation**: Cards to transform into other cards (`transform_cards`)
/// - **Messages**: Custom messages to display (`message`)
///
/// # Application Order
///
/// Effects are applied during scoring in this order:
/// 1. **Chips**: Base chips + all chip bonuses  
/// 2. **Mult**: Base mult + all mult bonuses
/// 3. **Mult Multipliers**: Apply all multipliers to total mult
/// 4. **Final Score**: (Total Chips) Ã— (Total Mult)
/// 5. **Resources**: Award money and apply modifiers
/// 6. **Special Effects**: Handle retriggering, destruction, transformation
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use balatro_rs::joker::JokerEffect;
///
/// // Simple scoring bonus
/// let effect = JokerEffect::new().with_mult(5);
///
/// // Combined scoring effect
/// let effect = JokerEffect::new()
///     .with_chips(50)
///     .with_mult(3)
///     .with_money(2);
///
/// // Multiplicative effect
/// let effect = JokerEffect::new().with_mult_multiplier(1.5); // +50% mult
///
/// // Complex effect with multiplicative bonus
/// let effect = JokerEffect::new()
///     .with_mult(10)
///     .with_mult_multiplier(2.0);
/// ```
///

/// pattern methods consume and return `self` to enable efficient method chaining
/// without additional allocations.

/// Core trait that all jokers must implement.
///
/// This trait defines the interface for all joker implementations in the Balatro-RS system.
/// Jokers can modify game scoring through lifecycle hooks and provide static information
/// about their identity and behavior.
///
/// # Implementation Patterns
///
/// There are several patterns for implementing jokers:
///
/// ## 1. Direct Implementation
/// For complex jokers requiring custom logic:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use balatro_rs::joker::{Joker, JokerId, JokerRarity, JokerEffect, GameContext};
/// use balatro_rs::card::Card;
/// use balatro_rs::hand::SelectHand;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct CustomJoker;
///
/// impl Joker for CustomJoker {
///     fn id(&self) -> JokerId { JokerId::CustomJoker }
///     fn name(&self) -> &str { "Custom Joker" }
///     fn description(&self) -> &str { "Complex custom logic" }
///     fn rarity(&self) -> JokerRarity { JokerRarity::Common }
///     
///     fn on_card_scored(&self, context: &mut GameContext, card: &Card) -> JokerEffect {
///         // Custom scoring logic
///         if self.complex_condition(context, card) {
///             JokerEffect::new().with_mult(5)
///         } else {
///             JokerEffect::new()
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## 2. Static Joker Framework
/// For simple conditional jokers:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use balatro_rs::static_joker::{StaticJoker, StaticCondition};
/// use balatro_rs::card::Suit;
///
/// let greedy_joker = StaticJoker::builder(
///     JokerId::GreedyJoker,
///     "Greedy Joker",
///     "+3 Mult per Diamond"
/// )
/// .rarity(JokerRarity::Common)
/// .mult(3)
/// .condition(StaticCondition::SuitScored(Suit::Diamond))
/// .per_card()
/// .build()?;
/// ```
///
/// # Lifecycle Events
///
/// Jokers integrate with the game through well-defined lifecycle events that mirror
/// Balatro's game flow:
///
/// 1. **Blind Start**: `on_blind_start()` - Called when a new blind begins
/// 2. **Hand Play**: `on_hand_played()` - Called when a hand is played for scoring
/// 3. **Card Scoring**: `on_card_scored()` - Called for each individual scoring card
/// 4. **Discard**: `on_discard()` - Called when cards are discarded
/// 5. **Shop**: `on_shop_open()` - Called when entering the shop
/// 6. **Round End**: `on_round_end()` - Called at the end of each round
///
/// # Effect Application
///
/// Joker effects are applied in a specific order to ensure consistent behavior:
/// 1. Chips calculation: Base chips + chip bonuses
/// 2. Mult calculation: Base mult + mult bonuses
/// 3. Mult multiplication: Apply mult multipliers
/// 4. Final score: chips Ã— mult
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All joker implementations must be `Send + Sync` to support concurrent access
/// in multi-threaded environments and RL training scenarios.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// - `on_card_scored()` is called most frequently and should be optimized
/// - Use early returns for non-matching conditions
/// - Avoid expensive operations in hot paths
/// - Consider caching expensive calculations in joker state
pub trait Joker: Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug {
    /// Get the unique identifier for this joker.
    ///
    /// This ID must be unique across all joker implementations and is used for
    /// state management, serialization, and factory creation.
