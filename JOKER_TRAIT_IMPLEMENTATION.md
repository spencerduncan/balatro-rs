# Joker Trait Implementation - Issue #52

## Summary

Successfully implemented the core Joker trait definition as specified in issue #52. The implementation provides a foundation for all 150 joker implementations with comprehensive lifecycle hooks and a clean API.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **core/src/joker/mod.rs** - Main joker trait definition
   - `JokerId` enum with all 150 joker identifiers
   - `JokerRarity` enum (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary)
   - `JokerEffect` struct for return values
   - `GameContext` struct for state access
   - `Joker` trait with Send + Sync bounds and all lifecycle methods

2. **core/src/joker_impl.rs** - Joker implementations
   - Implemented 15 basic jokers using the new trait system
   - Each joker properly implements the new trait methods

3. **core/src/joker_factory.rs** - Factory for creating jokers
   - Factory pattern for creating joker instances by ID
   - Helper methods to get jokers by rarity
   - Registry of all implemented jokers

4. **core/src/joker/compat.rs** - Compatibility layer
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
   - Bridges between new trait system and old API
   - Includes all existing tests

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Trait Definition**
   ```rust
   pub trait Joker: Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug {
       fn id(&self) -> JokerId;
       fn name(&self) -> &str;
       fn description(&self) -> &str;
       fn rarity(&self) -> JokerRarity;
       fn cost(&self) -> usize;
       
       // Lifecycle hooks
       fn on_hand_played(&self, context: &mut GameContext, hand: &SelectHand) -> JokerEffect;
       fn on_card_scored(&self, context: &mut GameContext, card: &Card) -> JokerEffect;
       fn on_blind_start(&self, context: &mut GameContext) -> JokerEffect;
       fn on_shop_open(&self, context: &mut GameContext) -> JokerEffect;
       fn on_discard(&self, context: &mut GameContext, cards: &[Card]) -> JokerEffect;
       fn on_round_end(&self, context: &mut GameContext) -> JokerEffect;
       
       // Modifier hooks
       fn modify_chips(&self, context: &GameContext, base_chips: i32) -> i32;
       fn modify_mult(&self, context: &GameContext, base_mult: i32) -> i32;
       fn modify_hand_size(&self, context: &GameContext, base_size: usize) -> usize;
       fn modify_discards(&self, context: &GameContext, base_discards: usize) -> usize;
   }
   ```

2. **JokerEffect Struct**
   - Supports chips, mult, money modifications
   - Mult multipliers for X-mult effects
   - Retrigger counts
   - Self/other destruction
   - Card transformations
   - Hand/discard modifiers
   - Custom messages

3. **GameContext Struct**
   - Provides safe, read-only access to game state
   - Includes current stats, stage, round info
   - References to other jokers, hand, and discarded cards

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Existing code continues to work unchanged
   - Old API is preserved through compatibility layer
   - All existing tests pass

## Testing

- All existing joker tests have been preserved and pass
- Build succeeds without errors
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Next Steps

This implementation unblocks the following tasks:
- #54: Implement joker save/load in GameAction
- #55: Task 2.1 - Implement basic scoring jokers
- #56: Task 2.2 - Implement hand manipulation jokers
- #61: Task 4.4: Blueprint/Brainstorm
- #70, #71, #72: Testing tasks

## Notes

- The trait includes Send + Sync bounds for thread safety as required
- Serialization support is included via serde
- The factory pattern allows for easy extension with new jokers
- Default implementations for all methods reduce boilerplate for simple jokers
